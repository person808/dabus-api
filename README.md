# DaBus API

## Description

A simple API wrapper around the DaBus API and DaBus's GTFS data.

## Running the server

A DaBus API token is needed. It is read from the `DABUS_API_KEY` environment
variable. The `db_upgrade.py` script requires a
[Transitfeeds](http://transitfeeds.com/) API key to be set at the
`TRANSITFEEDS_API_KEY` environment variable.
